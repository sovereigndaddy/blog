### About me

Software developer.

Freedom and privacy enthusiast.

Pro-individualist, anti-collectivist.

### Why did I create this site?
1. Before I die, I want to leave an imprint in reality related to the topics that matter most to me.
2. I hope to help others with their sovereign journey.
3. Document my work around the topics of freedom and privacy.
