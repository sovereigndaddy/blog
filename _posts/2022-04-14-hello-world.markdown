### About me

Software developer.

Freedom and privacy enthusiast.

Pro-individualist, anti-collectivist.

### Why did I create this site?
1. Document my work/projects around the topics of freedom and privacy.
2. I hope to help others with their sovereign journey.
3. Before I die, I want to leave an imprint in reality (digital and/or physical).
