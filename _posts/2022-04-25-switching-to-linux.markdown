### Why is Windows bad for Privacy?

Windows Operating Systems are by design bad for privacy, being guilty of using Windows for years, I've
seen the invasion of privacy that it can pose. Nothing surprising I guess, just read through their
[privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).
I'll take them at their word and assume they're doing the maximum amount of monitoring, collecting, and harvesting
of our personal data within the limits of the current laws. Enough said, let's check out our new OS..

### Why Linux?
