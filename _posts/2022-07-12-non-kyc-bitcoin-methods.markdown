# Intro
### KYC Brief Overview
KYC or **K**now **Y**our **C**ustomer or **K**now **Y**our **C**lient, is a standard used by financial institutions that was designed to protect against fraud, corruption, laundering, and "terrorist financing".

Here is a full [article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp) on KYC. I'd suggest reading through this if you want the full details, but in general, just know that when you purchase or sell from financial exchanges that require you go through the KYC process, you're handing over your:
- Full Name
- Address
- SSN
- Picture of your face

Once they have your data, you're at the mercy of them to properly secure and protect your data. You're at risk of malicious entities stealing your data, your data being sold, or your data being monitored and used for activities that you don't agree with at any point from here until eternity. The Bitcoin blockchain is immutable forever, so transactions you make today could be analyzed, judged, and in a worst case scenario prosecuted for reasons instituted by future governments. We can't predict the future and we can't control the continual privacy intrusions and theft of rights that these governments may try to implement.

KYC feeds the surveillance state. KYC is anti-Bitcoin.

### About this Post
In the content below, I outline the items, applications, and methods that I've personally used to acquire non-KYC Bitcoin, but by no means are these the only ways to of accomplishing this. As always, do your own research. 

Alright let's get to fighting against the surveillance state.

# Mining

## Bitcoin ASIC Mining
ASIC mining is the act of mining Bitcoin using a specialized computer device called an **A**pplication **S**pecific **I**ntegrated **C**ircuit miner; it does one thing and one thing only, **IT MINES BITCOIN**.

More specifically, the ASIC miner is designed to mine using a [proof of work](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work) algorithm called [SHA-256](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html), which is the [cryptographic hash algorithm](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/cryptographic-hash-functions/) that the Bitcoin network utilizes.

It's simple to run your miner at a basic level, you simply need the proper electricity to power the miner and access to the internet; no KYC required. Not only are you acquiring non-KYC Bitcoin by running an ASIC miner but you're also bolstering and supporting the Bitcoin network. 

### How to get started
#### Resources
Firstly, I strongly suggest reading both of these guides below. They are phenomenal resources on the topic of how to start home Bitcoin mining correctly, while also keeping security and privacy at the forefront.
- [Mining for the Streets](https://diverter.hostyourown.tools/mining-for-the-streets/)
- [Home mining for non-KYC Bitcoin](https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/home-mining-for-non-kyc-bitcoin)

#### Prepare Environment
Before you spend a cent on a physical Bitcoin ASIC miner, prepare your environment for your new mining setup. The last thing you want to do is ruin your ASIC miner/s or even worse, start an electrical fire because your home's electrical setup didn't meet the minimum requirements to be running an ASIC miner.
- Electrical infrastructure setup. You'll need at least a 220 volt outlet so have the required electricity and components installed.
  - I'm currently having a home built and am having 220 volt outlets installed for my home mining setup, so I'll try to document that process as well.
  - *Note: depending on how many miners you plan to run, your electricity needs will obviously vary based on that factor so verify your math or have a licensed electrician assist you so you don't fuck this critical part up.*
- Determine how you'll handle the ASIC miner effects as it is loud AF and hotter than the devil's dick.
  - Options:
    - Build a box that will house your Bitcoin ASIC miner, thus reducing sound decibels and allowing for the heat to be properly venting through ducting.
    - Set up an immersion mining tank. This will eliminate both noise and heat from the environment but you'll have to have the proper setup to cool the liquid.
      - Here's a good intro [article](https://compassmining.io/education/immersion-bitcoin-mining-introduction/) on immersion mining, read up on the topic and get to work!

#### Buy ASIC Miner

*Note: There are many other sources that you can purchase ASIC miners from but I can't confirm the legitimacy of those sources so I'm not going to mention them.*

Below are the marketplaces that I've successfully purchased Bitcoin ASIC miners without any issues. 
- [KaboomRacks](https://t.me/s/kaboomracks)
- [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/)

Specifically, I purchased two of the [Bitmain Antminer S9J](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-s9j-14-5th) models. The first one I paid $480.00 and the second one I paid $390.00, both miners came with a Antminer APW7 **P**ower **S**upply **U**nit so I didn't need to purchase anything additional. 

The reason the price decreased between the two purchases was that I purchased the first miner when the bitcoin price was at $45K and by the time I purchased the second miner the bitcoin price had dropped to about $21K levels. This is a great example to illustrate how these ASIC miners value is currently directly correlated with the bitcoin price, hashing difficulty, and overall mining competition as all of these combined will impact the profitability, but luckily for me, I don't give a shit about the profitability, this venture is solely about acquiring non-KYC so let's keep on keepin on.

# P2P Exchanges
All of these options below are peer to peer exchanges that I have personally bought bitcoin from. When using these applications you are trading/swapping directly with your peers, there is no centralized third party involved. Each offering their own advantages, I'd suggest doing a bit of research into each and then choose one.
- [Bisq](https://bisq.network/)
  - Decentralized
  - Non-Custodial
  - Tor by default
  - No-KYC

  ***Note:*** *Bisq requires a security deposit in bitcoin. This helps deter malicious entities from attempting to defraud Bisq's users, but it also can be seen as a barrier because before you can buy bitcoin you first have to deposit bitcoin...*
- [RoboSats](http://robosats6tkf3eva7x2voqso3a5wcorsnw34jveyxfqi2fu7oyheasid.onion)
  - Decentralized
  - Non-Custodial
  - No-KYC
  - Requires [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) to use full functionality

# Coin Mixing
I want to mention coin mixing as this should be done by any privacy conscious Bitcoiner. This technique creates it exponentially more difficult to track your identity and further helps preserve your privacy.

In my laments terms, coin mixing is the technique of: 
- Pooling your bitcoin with other peers
- Mixing your coins together using magical techniques that the coin mixing services perform 
- bitcoin are spit back out at random amounts to eventually equal the original amount you sent in. 

***Note:*** *Mixing your bitcoin can essentially flag your bitcoin so if you ever attempted to sell it on a centralized exchange you may be denied service. This is accomplished by centralized exchanges determining if any of your bitcoin is linked to addresses associated with coin mixing.*

# TODO
- Bitcoin ATMs
  - I need to go to a Bitcoin ATM, I'll update the post after I complete this...

# Wrapping Up
You can **NEVER** un-KYC yourself so be extremely cautious about who you hand over your data to.

Take steps now to secure your future and put yourself on the path of privacy and security because...
