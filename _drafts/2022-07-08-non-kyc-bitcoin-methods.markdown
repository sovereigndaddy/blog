# Intro
KYC or **K**now **Y**our **C**ustomer, is a standard used by financial institutions that was designed to protect against fraud, corruption, laundering, and "terrorist financing".

When you utilize financial exchanges that require you go through the KYC process, you are handing over your personal information, your SSN, your current location, and your picture to an institution that may or may not keep all of this data secure. You're at risk of your data is being sold and ultimately becoming a victim of the surveillance state. 

KYC feeds the state surveillance. KYC is anti-Bitcoin. 

In the content below, I outline the ways that I use to bypass KYC and do my best to fight against the surveillance state in the ever-encroaching world of big data.
