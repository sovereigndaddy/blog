# Intro
KYC or **K**now **Y**our **C**ustomer, is a standard used by financial institutions that was designed to protect against fraud, corruption, laundering, and "terrorist financing".

When you utilize financial exchanges that require you go through the KYC process, you are handing over your personal information, your SSN, your current location, and your picture to an institution that may or may not keep all of this data secure. You're at risk of your data is being sold and ultimately becoming a victim of the surveillance state. 

KYC feeds the state surveillance. KYC is anti-Bitcoin. 

You can **NEVER** un-KYC yourself so be extremely cautious about who you hand over your data to.


In the content below, I outline the ways that I use to bypass KYC and do my best to fight against the surveillance state in the ever-encroaching world of big data.

# Mining

## ASIC Mining
### Bitcoin ASIC Mining
ASIC mining is the act of mining Bitcoin using a specialized computer device called an **A**pplication **S**pecific **I**ntegrated **C**ircuit miner; it does one thing and one thing only, **IT MINES BITCOIN**.

More specifically, the ASIC miner is designed to mine using a particular algorithm called [SHA-256](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html), which is the cryptographic hash algorithm that the Bitcoin network utilizes.
### How to get started

#### Resources
Firstly, I strongly suggest reading both of these guides below. They are phenomenal resources on the topic of how to start home Bitcoin mining correctly, while also keeping security and privacy at the forefront.
- [Mining for the Streets](https://diverter.hostyourown.tools/mining-for-the-streets/)
- [Home mining for non-KYC Bitcoin](https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/home-mining-for-non-kyc-bitcoin)

#### Prepare Environment
Before you spend a cent on a physical Bitcoin ASIC miner, prepare your environment for your new mining setup. The last thing you want to do is ruin your ASIC miner/s or even worse, start an electrical fire because your home's electrical setup didn't meet the minimum requirements to be running an ASIC miner.
- You'll need a 220 volt outlet, have the required electricity needs and components installed.
  - *Note: depending on how many miners you plan to run, your electricity needs will obviously vary based on that factor so verify your math or have a licensed electrician assist you so you don't fuck this critical part up.*
- Determine how you'll handle the ASIC miner effects as it is loud AF and hotter than the devil's dick.
  - Options:
    - Build a box that will house your Bitcoin ASIC miner, thus reducing sound and allowing for ducting that will properly route the heat.
    - Setup an immersion mining tank that will eliminate both noise and heat from the air around you.

#### Buy ASIC Miner
Below are the marketplaces that I've successfully purchased Bitcoin ASIC miners without any issues. 
- [KaboomRacks](https://t.me/s/kaboomracks)
- [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/)

## GPU Mining
### What is GPU Mining?
### How to get started
The simplest way to get started GPU miner is use a desktop computer that you own already, you'll be able to utilize the GPU that is installed currently. One caveat, is you'll need to do some initial baseline tests on your computer system to see if you GPU is powerful enough to mine, if it is then you're good to go and can start Bitcoin mining.
