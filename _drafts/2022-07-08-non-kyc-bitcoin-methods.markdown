# Intro
### KYC Brief Overview
KYC or **K**now **Y**our **C**ustomer or **K**now **Y**our **C**lient, is a standard used by financial institutions that was designed to protect against fraud, corruption, laundering, and "terrorist financing".

Here is a full [article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp) on KYC. I'd suggest reading through this if you want the full details, but in general, just know that when you purchase or sell from financial exchanges that require you go through the KYC process, you're handing over your:
- Full Name
- Address
- SSN
- Picture of your face

Once they have your data, you're at the mercy of them to properly secure and protect your data. And utilmately, you're at risk of malicious entities stealing your data, your data being sold, your data being monitored and use for activities that you don't agree with. 

KYC feeds the state surveillance. KYC is anti-Bitcoin.

### About this Post
In the content below, I outline the items, applications, and methods that I've personally used to acquire non-KYC Bitcoin, but by no means are these the only ways to of accomplishing this. As always, do your own research. 

Alright let's get to fighting against the surveillance state.

# Mining

## Bitcoin ASIC Miningparty on
ASIC mining is the act of mining Bitcoin using a specialized computer device called an **A**pplication **S**pecific **I**ntegrated **C**ircuit miner; it does one thing and one thing only, **IT MINES BITCOIN**.

More specifically, the ASIC miner is designed to mine using a particular algorithm called [SHA-256](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html), which is the cryptographic hash algorithm that the Bitcoin network utilizes.

Not only are we acquiring non-KYC Bitcoin by running an ASIC miner but you're also bolstering and supporting the Bitcoin network. In my opinion, there should be a miner in all homes, run dat shit dawg.

### How to get started
#### Resources
Firstly, I strongly suggest reading both of these guides below. They are phenomenal resources on the topic of how to start home Bitcoin mining correctly, while also keeping security and privacy at the forefront.
- [Mining for the Streets](https://diverter.hostyourown.tools/mining-for-the-streets/)
- [Home mining for non-KYC Bitcoin](https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/home-mining-for-non-kyc-bitcoin)

#### Prepare Environment
Before you spend a cent on a physical Bitcoin ASIC miner, prepare your environment for your new mining setup. The last thing you want to do is ruin your ASIC miner/s or even worse, start an electrical fire because your home's electrical setup didn't meet the minimum requirements to be running an ASIC miner.
- You'll need a 220 volt outlet, have the required electricity needs and components installed.
  - *Note: depending on how many miners you plan to run, your electricity needs will obviously vary based on that factor so verify your math or have a licensed electrician assist you so you don't fuck this critical part up.*
- Determine how you'll handle the ASIC miner effects as it is loud AF and hotter than the devil's dick.
  - Options:
    - Build a box that will house your Bitcoin ASIC miner, thus reducing sound decibels and allowing for the heat to be properly venting through ducting.
    - Set up an immersion mining tank. This will eliminate both noise and heat from the environment but you'll have to have the proper setup to cool the liquid.
      - Here's a good intro [article](https://compassmining.io/education/immersion-bitcoin-mining-introduction/) on immersion mining, read up on the topic and get to work!

#### Buy ASIC Miner

*Note: There are many other sources that you can purchase ASIC miners from but I can't confirm the legitimacy of those sources so I'm not going to mention them.*

Below are the marketplaces that I've successfully purchased Bitcoin ASIC miners without any issues. 
- [KaboomRacks](https://t.me/s/kaboomracks)
- [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/)

Specifically, I purchased two of the [Bitmain Antminer S9J](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-s9j-14-5th) models. The first one I paid $480.00 and the second one I paid $390.00, both miners came with a Antminer APW7 **P**ower **S**upply **U**nit so I didn't need to purchase anything additional. 

The reason the price decreased between the two purchases was that I purchased the first miner when the bitcoin price was at $45K and by the time I purchased the second miner the bitcoin price had dropped to about $21K levels. This is a great example to illustrate how these ASIC miners value is currently directly correlated with the bitcoin price, hashing difficulity, and overall mining competition as all of these combined will impact the profitability, but luckily for me, I don't give a shit about the profitability, this venture is solely about acquiring non-KYC so let's keep on keepin on.

# P2P Exchanges
All of these options below are peer to peer exchanges, meaning you are trading/swapping directly with your peers, there is no centralized third party involved. Some being more decentralized than others though and each offering their own advantages. I'd suggest doing a bit of research into each then choosing one.
- [Bisq](https://bisq.network/)
- [Hodl Hodl](https://hodlhodl.com/)
- [Local Coin Swap](https://localcoinswap.com/)
- [RoboSats](http://robosats6tkf3eva7x2voqso3a5wcorsnw34jveyxfqi2fu7oyheasid.onion)

# Wrapping Up
You can **NEVER** un-KYC yourself so be extremely cautious about who you hand over your data to.

Take steps now to secure your future and put yourself on the path of privacy and security because...
