Since you should ALWAYS be concerned with privacy when utilizing Bitcoin, this post will be about my use of the [Sparrow Wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) along with my [BitBox02](https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02/) hardware wallet. In combination these devices are helping me accomplish adequate privacy when sending and receiving Bitcoin transactions while at the same time increasing usability of the wallet.

# Why BitBox02
A couple years back I purchased the [BitBox02](https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02/) Bitcoin-only edition and I haven't regretted it for a second. It has top of the line security and a great user interface which allows for simple and easy usage. The BitBox02 has been designed around security and the potential vulnerabilities that its users could face when sending and receiving Bitcoin, so when I use the device I'm confident that my risk of compromise is extremely low.

One item to call out here, the Bitcoin-only edition is the ONLY option that you should buy if you're planning on purchasing a BitBox02. This edition has its firmware exclusively dedicated to supporting Bitcoin, which in turn means less code and less attack surface for potential malicious attacks.

# Why Sparrow Wallet

# Setup

## Sparrow Wallet Install

I've preached this before, but ALWAYS verify your installation file is the one you expected to download and was not compromised during the download.
