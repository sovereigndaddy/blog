## Pretty Good Privacy
PGP stands for **P**retty **G**ood **P**rivacy. In short, it's an encryption system that utilizes public key cryptography to authenticate and encrypt data.

When using PGP, you will have 2 keys, 1 public key and 1 private key...

### Public Key
Your public key should be broadcast to the world. Put it on your blog, your social media accounts, etc.

This is my PGP public key

### Private Key

Your private key must be kept a secret, as this is the key that gives you the ability to decrypt messages and data and provide your signature to authenticate yourself.

If your private key, gets leaked or hacked, then in theory, whoever has your private key will have the ability to decrypt messages and data sent with your publi key.


When I send you data for example, I would encrypt the data with your public key so when you receive it you will be able to decrypt the data using your private key.
