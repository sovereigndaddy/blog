Running your own personal server is a required step if you want to have digital sovereignty. It can replace one of the most common cloud services... cloud storage, aka Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.

I want to get away from cloud services, although easier said than done. Over the years, I've acquired and interacted with numerous services from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. thus giving them my data, my location, my activity, and so on. Within the past year, I've slowly been converting my use from big tech services to free and open source alternatives.

This post will be about my experience with the [Start9 Embassy](https://store.start9.com/products/embassy) personal server. How I set it up and my usage of the device to date.

<br/>
## Big Tech Cloud Services
Let's start out with society's ever increasing reliance on big tech. We willingly hand over our data, and along with it our privacy, in return for a shiny app that promises to handle ALL of our data responsibility for us. What they fail to mention is the trade-off, and how when you forfeit responsibility to a third party, you also transfer all ownership, security, and trust of said data because it lives within their servers. You're saying, I 100% trust this company to do the right thing with my data. They are the trusted third party throughout the remainder of your relationship, you're at their mercy on how your data will be stored and secured.

<br/>
## Quick overview
### Software
[Start9 Embassy](https://store.start9.com/products/embassy) is a plug and play personal server. The Embassy OS allows the ability to use open source, trusted applications, without the need for a third party; everything runs within the embassy device itself.

### Hardware
I bought my physical hardware [device](https://store.start9.com/products/embassy) about a year ago. The default setup, ran off of a SD card, but recently, there was a major version upgrade to 0.3.0 that required an [upgrade kit](https://store.start9.com/products/upgrade-kit), so it now runs using an 1 TB Solid State Drive ([SSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive))
