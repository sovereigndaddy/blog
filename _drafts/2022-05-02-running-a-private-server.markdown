Due to the increased monitoring and collection of data, which you can read through Microsoft's [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement) to see exactly what they are doing with our data, I'm switching all of my machines from Windows to Linux. This blog will document the adventure I went through when converting one of my machines....

## Big Tech Services?
Let's start out with society's ever increasing reliance on big tech. We willingly hand over our data, and along with it our privacy, in return for a shiny app that promises to handle ALL of our data responsibility for us. What they fail to mention is the trade-off, and how when you forfeit responsibility to a third party, you also transfer all ownership, security, and trust of said data because it lives within their servers. You're saying I 100% trust this company to do the right thing with my data. You're saying, I 100% trust this company to provide me access to my data...

Getting away from these cloud services is easier said than done and I'm as guilty as anyone else for using them. Over the years, I've acquired and interacted with numerous services from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. thus giving them my data, my location, my activity, and so on. Within the past year, I've slowly been converting my use of big tech services to free and open source alternatives, so this post will be about my experience with the [Start9 Embassy](https://store.start9.com/products/embassy) setup and usage to date.
