KYC, short for **K**now **Y**our **C**ustomer, is a standard used by financial institutions that was designed to protect against fraud, corruption, laundering, and "terrorist financing".

When you utilize financial exchanges that require you go through the KYC process, you are handing over your personal information, your SSN, your current location, and your picture to an exchange that may or may not keep all of this data secure. You have the risk that your data is being sold, your data is being utilized for state surveillance, etc.

KYC is anti-Bitcoin.

KYC feeds a system of state surveillance.
