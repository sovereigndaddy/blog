# About this post
This post is a short story on how I was exposed to Bitcoin, fell into the moon boy abyss, and how I was able to pull myself up from the depths...

# The bitcoin Price
Bitcoin is freedom, but unfortunately 99% of the people that know about Bitcoin miss this point. They are only aware about the price of bitcoin and how much more they can stuff into their bags and cash out before the next great crypto crash. Until they truly understand the purpose and functionality of Bitcoin, they'll always be blinded by the price.

I fell into this category of price obsession. Back in late 2016 I made my first bitcoin transaction, only buying a little bit, but I had this idea in my mind that Bitcoin was "going to the moon". I would check the price every hour or more and obsess about the price patterns. I would buy Bitcoin on centralized crypto exchanges, trade on centralized platforms, etc. I was strictly trying to increase the amount of Bitcoin I owned without the care as to where and how I bought it.

The only reason in the world I bought some was my intrigue after a conversation with a friend some months back, and to be honest,  when I first was told of Bitcoin, I was skeptical of it, this video game money sounded risky to me haha, anyways I immediately stuffed that convo deep into the back of my brain. It took some months later, when I had another random non-technical friend text me and ask about another cryptocurrency called XRP that I became fully emersed in the cryptocurrency world. P.S., I know XRP is garbage, but I will have to give XRP credit that my friend's interest in it sparked my love for cryptocurrency (Bitcoin specifically) that continues to grow each day.
