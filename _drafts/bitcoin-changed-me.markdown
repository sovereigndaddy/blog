# About this post
This post is a short post on my exposure to Bitcoin and how I evolved from price obsession to Bitcoin privacy enthusiast.
<br/>
# Blinded by the Price
Bitcoin is freedom, but unfortunately most people that know about Bitcoin miss this point completely. They're only aware about the price of bitcoin, what they hear about it on the evening news, or how they should hurry and buy more before it goes to 1 million USD per bitcoin (FOMO). It's only until you take a step back and awaken from the price fallacy, that you'll come to the realization that the Bitcoin network itself is an uncensorable and unstoppable force.

I fell into this category of price obsession. Back in late 2016 I made my first bitcoin transaction, here's how I acted:
- I was obsessed about the Bitcoin price "going to the moon".

  <br/>
- I would check the price constantly!

  <br/>
- I would buy Bitcoin on any centralized crypto exchanges handing out my identity to pretty much whoever wanted it.

Looking back, I feel foolish for behaving like this but I just didn't fully grasp what Bitcoin even was until about a year into it so I guess I'll take it as a learning experience ha...
<br/>
# My Price Enlightenment
I awoke from this price obsession after actually taking the time to sit down and read the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). This completely changed my life, as I came to the realization that Bitcoin is not just another investment opportunity, but it's a freedom network for the people.

It sparked a fire inside me that drove me to researching the issues with the traditional banking system and how we're being used by the system. Bitcoin aims to solve the problems that are currently plaguing us, below I list out these issues that I see and how Bitcoin can help solve these issues while at the same time providing complete autonomy for the individual utilizing it.
<br/>
# Traditional Banking Issues
- **Accessibility:** Banking systems are only online for a specific number of days and hours during the week. If you need to send money when the bank is not open then you'll be SOL.
- **Censorship:** In theory, if you think or act the wrong way that is against the current accepted narrative that is being spread by the banks, government, media, etc. then you are at risk. The banks and/or government have the ability to freeze your banking accounts. A recent example of this was the Canadian Trucker Protest where anyone who supported the anti-mandate protest was subject to having their bank accounts frozen; article [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60383385).
- **Data collection:** More surveillance capitalism here. Banks collect and sell your data to 3rd party companies, specifically your credit and debit card activity, so where you shop, how you pay, and what time of day that you go shopping are all being sold to these companies.
- **Fees:** This is obvious, banks are loaded with fees. A fee to have the luxury of even having a bank account open, an overdraft fee if your balance falls below $0, a fee to send my own money; the list goes on...
- **Financial Inclusion:** Many banking products, rates, payment options are set aside for a special group of people, thus leaving the majority of individuals stuck to the unfavorable banking standards.
- **Security issues:** Centralized banking systems are proprietary software, you have to put 100% trust that the people responsible for the source code have discovered all security vulnerabilities.
- **Transaction Time:** If you send an international payment right now, it will take multiple days to get to its destination.
<br/>
# Bitcoin Solves This

### Bitcoin Traits
- **Accessibility:** The Bitcoin network never sleeps. You can send/receive a transaction on ANY day at ANY time.
- **Anonymity:** You can be anonymous within the Bitcoin network as long as you participate carefully and responsibly. No government or central authority can easily track your activity.
- **Control:** There is no centrally controlled bank that is holding your money for you. The Bitcoin is in your wallet, under your control.
- **Decentralized:** There is no central authority that oversees the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin at its core is a decentralized peer to peer monetary network that allows anyone in the entire world access to participate in the Bitcoin network.
- **Uncensorable:** Anyone, anywhere in the world, and at anytime can send a Bitcoin transaction. No bank or government in the entire world can stop a transaction from being sent/received.

<br/>
***Note: The items below are traits of Bitcoin as long as you are holding your Bitcoin in your OWN wallet/s. Centralized exchanges, can eliminate these aspects as the exchanges own the Bitcoin for you and are only allowing you access to the wallet that is holding that Bitcoin.***

# My Bitcoin Ventures
Over the past couple years, I've come to full appreciation of the Bitcoin network and realize the true possibilities that are in front of all us when using this life-altering technology.

If you want to be a sovereign individual, then you must use Bitcoin. Get away from these centralized banking systems and start taking back your financial control. When you give the banks control of your money, you're at their mercy.

I've been fully supporting the Bitcoin network using any available method as I find time to complete these projects. I'll run through my general Bitcoin setup, as of today, and the benefits of doing so...

## Running Bitcoin Nodes

### Why run a node?
  When you run a Bitcoin node, you help:
  - Bolster and strengthen the network by providing your resources to validate every transaction before it gets added to the Bitcoin blockchain, thus increasing the security of the network.
  - Monitor the network to ensure it remains in a healthy state, since your node is constantly validating it will ensure the Bitcoin network has not been manipulated in any way.
  - Increase your own privacy since you can connect your wallet to your own node, you don't have to put your trust in someone else's node when sending/receiving transactions that may compromise your personal information.

  - **"NOT YOUR NODE, NOT YOUR RULES"**

  To help support the network and verify transactions, these are my current devices:

  - [MyNode](https://mynodebtc.com/)

## Running Bitcoin miner:

### Why run a miner?

  **EARN NON-[KYC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp) BITCOIN**

  *Note: NON-KYC Bitcoin is a critical topic and will be discussed in detail in a future blog post :)*

# Wrapping Up
Bitcoin changed me, I can't un-see what I have already seen, I can't unread what I've already read. Banks will never look the same. Government will never look the same. Money is freedom, but it is also a control mechanism; let them control the money and they will control you.

<h3>Bitcoin: fix the money, fix the world</h3>
